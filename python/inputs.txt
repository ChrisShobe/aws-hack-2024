------------

I am trying to make multiple meals for a Thanksgiving dinner. There will be 5-10 people there that I have to feed. I need to manage my time well as I am making 2 different dishes, so I need to make both at the same time and switch between preparing and cooking both dishes. I want to make sure all my food is hot and ready to go at the same time so my guests will be happy. I am confused about what steps can be done in parallel and how much time they would take. I have 1 stove and 1 oven to use. I have a little experience in cooking, and am unsure of how to go about making this Thanksgiving dinner.
