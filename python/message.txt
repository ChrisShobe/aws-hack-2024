Here are the recipes I want help with. Look at the total time it takes to finish each of the recipes. Our main priority when cooking both recipes in parallel is for both of the recipes to be finished at the same time. For each step in the recipe, identify which steps can be done in parallel or sequentially. I also need to know which steps go with what recipe to avoid confusion over which step correlates with what. We want to emphasize that you stick to the recipe ingredients and steps and don’t generate any additional information. Put all on one line and no newlines.

Whenever a step involves actively cooking, baking, simmering, or completing an action for a specific time, set a timer for that step. This includes overlapping steps across both recipes. Each cooking timer should be tracked independently, even if there’s already another active timer for a different recipe. Ensure the instructions include reminders to check, stir, flip, or remove items from heat once the timer goes off. Organize the directions clearly, so all steps and timers are easy to follow, and no action is missed due to overlapping timers. If a timer ends during another step, include a reminder to pause and remove the item from heat before continuing. Track cumulative time elapsed as you combine the recipes, ensuring they finish cooking simultaneously.
Label each step/direction and substep with the recipe names
While both recipes should finish at the same time, they DON’T have to start at the same time.

IMPORTANT: Do this only if two recipes both intended to be served HOT. If one recipe is intended to be served hot and the other cold or room temperature, or if both recipes are intended to be served cool, this doesn’t apply. If the 2 hot recipes can’t be completed at the same time (e.g. they need to bake in the oven at drastically different temperatures), output that they can’t be completed in parallel. For example, output (“Can’t be done in parallel.”) There is only ONE oven that the user can use, so different oven temperatures cannot be used at the same time. Format everything on one line for a computer to take as one singular input. Do not have newlines, and have all text be normal text with no “*”. Anytime you see a new line, just create a space between the information not an actual new line.

OUTPUT: Return the final recipe with the combined ingredients and instructions in one line with no newlines. 

Instructions:
Evaluate the total time needed for each recipe and prioritize timing so both recipes finish at the same time if they are served hot. For each recipe step, identify whether it can be done in parallel or sequentially. Clearly label each step with the recipe name to prevent confusion about which steps belong to which recipe.
Timers:
For any step involving cooking, baking, simmering, or timing, set independent timers. Include reminders to check, stir, flip, or remove items from heat when the timer ends. If a timer is set during another step, remind the user to pause and remove the item from heat before continuing.
Parallel Cooking:
Steps can start at different times to achieve simultaneous completion. If oven temperatures for two hot recipes differ significantly or if they cannot otherwise be cooked together, note that parallel preparation is not possible. This process does not apply to recipes served cold or at room temperature.
Example Input:
Recipe 1: https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/230103/buttery-garlic-green-beans/
Prep Time: 5 mins
Cook Time: 10 mins
Total Time: 15 mins
Servings: 4
Ingredients:
1 pound fresh green beans, trimmed and snapped in half
3 tablespoons butter
3 cloves garlic, minced
⅛ teaspoon lemon-pepper seasoning, or more to taste
salt to taste
Directions:
Place green beans into a large skillet and cover with water; bring to a boil.
Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until beans just start to soften, 3 to 5 minutes.
Drain and return to the skillet. Add butter and stir until melted, 1 to 2 minutes.
Add garlic; cook until tender and fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes.
Season with lemon-pepper seasoning and salt before serving.
Recipe 2: https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/9111/cranberry-sauce/
Prep Time: 5 mins
Cook Time: 15 mins
Total Time: 20 mins
Servings: 10
Ingredients:
12 ounces cranberries
1 cup white sugar
1 cup orange juice
Directions:
Gather all ingredients.
Dissolve sugar in orange juice in a medium saucepan over medium heat.
Stir in cranberries and cook until they start to pop, about 8 to 10 minutes.
Remove from heat and place sauce in a bowl. It will thicken as it cools.
Output:
Provide the final combined recipe as one single line with no newlines or special characters like "*". Include all ingredients grouped by recipe and list the combined directions with cumulative time tracked, ensuring clarity and no missed steps. When formatting, replace any newlines with spaces.
Example Output (as seen, everything is on one line. make sure it is all on one line no matter what. copy the format below for all inputs. FOLLOW THIS EXACT FORMAT BUT USE YOUR ACTUAL RECIPES GIVEN, NOT GREEN BEANS AND CRANBERRY SAUCE):
Buttery Garlic Green Beans (RECIPE 1 <Insert Recipe Name>) Yield: 4 servings Cranberry Sauce Yield: 10 servings Ingredients: Buttery Garlic Green Beans: 1 pound fresh green beans, trimmed and snapped in half / 3 tablespoons butter / 3 cloves garlic, minced / ⅛ teaspoon lemon-pepper seasoning, or more to taste / salt to taste Cranberry Sauce (RECIPE 2 <Insert Recipe Name>): 12 ounces cranberries / 1 cup white sugar / 1 cup orange juice Steps: 1. (Recipe 2 <Insert Recipe Name>) Gather all cranberry sauce ingredients. 2. (Recipe 2 <Insert Recipe Name>) Dissolve sugar in orange juice in a medium saucepan over medium heat. 3. (Recipe 1 <Insert Recipe Name>) Place green beans into a large skillet and cover with water; bring to a boil. 4. (Recipe 1 <Insert Recipe Name>) Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer green beans until just softening, 3 to 5 mins. Set green bean timer. 5. (Recipe 2 <Insert Recipe Name>) Stir cranberries into orange juice mixture and cook until cranberries pop, about 8 to 10 mins. Set cranberry sauce timer. 6. (Recipe 1 <Insert Recipe Name>) Once green bean timer goes off, drain beans and return to skillet. 7. (Recipe 1 <Insert Recipe Name>) Add butter and stir until melted, 1 to 2 mins. 8. (Recipe 1 <Insert Recipe Name>) Add garlic and cook until tender and fragrant, 1 to 2 mins. 9. (Recipe 2 <Insert Recipe Name>) If cranberry sauce timer goes off, remove cranberries from heat before continuing green beans. 10. (Recipe 1 <Insert Recipe Name>) Once cranberries are cooked, remove from heat and place sauce in bowl to thicken as it cools. 11. (Recipe 1 <Insert Recipe Name>) Season green beans with lemon-pepper and salt. Both dishes should now be ready to serve the buttery garlic green beans and cranberry sauce together.

OUTPUT: Return the final recipe with the combined ingredients and instructions in one line. 

ADDITIONAL NOTE:  Track the amount of time that has passed anytime you are changing the temperature/cooking/heating an item from both recipes. Additionally, keep track of the time it takes to complete the next step for both recipes. For every cooking step for both recipes, put on a timer as a reminder to remove the recipe from the stovetop/oven. Or if a specific time is given for a specific action, add a timer.
If the timer would go off within the next step, within that step, remind the user to remove the item from the stove/oven. For example, if the cook time for an item is 1-2 minutes and the cook/prep time for the next step is 3-4 minutes, remind the user in the 3-4 minute step to remove the 1-2 minute item within the same step. 
The first time generated is correct. Ensure later iterations are also done correctly not just the first attempt.
