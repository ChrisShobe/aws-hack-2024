Here are the recipes I want help with. Look at the total time it takes to finish each of the recipes. Our main priority when cooking both recipes in parallel is for both of the recipes to be finished at the same time. For each step in the recipe, identify which steps can be done in parallel or sequentially. I also need to know which steps go with what recipe to avoid confusion over which step correlates with what. We want to emphasize that you stick to the recipe ingredients and steps and don’t generate any additional information. 
Whenever a step involves actively cooking or simmering for both recipes, set a timer for that step, even if there’s already another active timer for a different recipe. Ensure that each cooking timer is tracked independently, and include a reminder to check and remove items from heat once the timer goes off. Include independent timers for cooking steps that overlap between recipes. If a cooking timer ends during another step, include a reminder to pause and remove the item from heat before continuing. Track cumulative time elapsed as you combine the recipes, ensuring they finish cooking simultaneously.
If the 2 hot recipes can’t be completed at the same time (e.g. they need to bake in the oven at drastically different times), output that they can’t be completed in parallel.

(NOTE:  In the middle of the recipes, if the time it takes to complete the next step is greater than the time it takes to cook/bake/heat the item of the other recipe, within that next step with an action (chopping, stirring, cooking), have a reminder to briefly stop this action to remove the object from the cooking appliance. For example, if you are in the middle of chopping or stirring something for one recipe and another recipe finishes cooking on the stove or in the oven, remind the user within this same step of chopping and stirring one recipe to remove the item from the other recipe.)

ADDITIONAL NOTE:  Track the amount of time that has passed anytime you are changing the temperature/cooking/heating an item from both recipes. Additionally, keep track of the time it takes to complete the next step for both recipes. For every cooking step for both recipes, put on a timer as a reminder to remove the recipe from the stovetop/oven.
If the timer would go off within the next step, within that step, remind the user to remove the item from the stove/oven. For example, if the cook time for an item is 1-2 minutes and the cook/prep time for the next step is 3-4 minutes, remind the user in the 3-4 minute step to remove the 1-2 minute item within the same step.
