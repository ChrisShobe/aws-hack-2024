Directions:

1. (Pumpkin Pie) Preheat the oven to 350°F.
2. (Pumpkin Pie) Line a cupcake or mini tart tray with paper liners.
3. (Pumpkin Pie) In a food processor or blender, process hazelnuts, flour, sugar, coconut oil, and salt. Add 2 tbsp water and pulse until the dough forms. The texture should be like coarse, wet sand.
4. (Pumpkin Pie) Add about 2 tbsp of crust dough to each of the paper cups. Press and flatten the dough into the cup using the fingers.
5. (Pumpkin Pie) Bake the crust for 15 minutes. Set a timer for 15 minutes.

6. (Turkey) While the pumpkin pie crust is baking, prepare the turkey for roasting.
7. (Turkey) Remove any innards from the turkey. Remove any excess fat from the neck or chest cavity and rinse the cavities thoroughly with cool water and pat dry.
8. (Turkey) Season the turkey liberally with salt and black pepper.
9. (Turkey) Combine the butter, orange juice, maple syrup, thyme, salt, and black pepper in a microwave-safe bowl. Heat to melt, about 60 seconds.
10. (Turkey) Stuff the turkey lightly with your desired stuffing, about 7 cups total. If there is skin to pull together to cover the stuffing, secure it with skewers. If this skin has been trimmed off, cover the exposed stuffing with foil.
11. (Turkey) Add bay leaves, chopped vegetables, garlic, and 1 cup of stock (or water) to the roasting pan.
12. (Turkey) Place a roasting rack in the pan (one that is high enough to hold the turkey above the liquids).
13. (Turkey) Brush the turkey liberally with the melted thyme butter and place on the rack, breast side down.

14. (Pumpkin Pie) When the timer goes off, remove the pumpkin pie crust from the oven.
15. (Pumpkin Pie) In the meantime, blend the pumpkin pie filling ingredients together until thoroughly mixed and creamy.
16. (Pumpkin Pie) Melt the chocolate chips using the double boiler method or simply microwaving for about 1 minute.
17. (Pumpkin Pie) Add about 2 tsp melted chocolate into the center of each mini pie crust and spread it out and up toward the sides.
18. (Pumpkin Pie) Fill the remaining space in each mini pie crust with the pumpkin mixture.

19. (Turkey) Place the prepared turkey in the preheated oven and set a timer for 4 hours.
20. (Pumpkin Pie) Bake the pumpkin pies in the oven alongside the turkey for about 20-24 minutes. Set a timer for 20 minutes.

21. (Pumpkin Pie) When the 20-minute timer goes off, check the pumpkin pies. If the edges are lightly browned, remove them from the oven.
22. (Pumpkin Pie) Cool the pumpkin pies to room temperature, then chill in the fridge for at least 2 hours.

23. (Turkey) Baste the turkey every 30 minutes with the thyme butter.
24. (Turkey) After 1 hour, flip the turkey onto its back for the remaining cooking time.
25. (Turkey) If any areas of the turkey start to darken too quickly, cover lightly with foil.
26. (Turkey) Continue to baste the turkey every 30 minutes.
27. (Turkey) If the pan dries out, add additional stock or water. Never let the pan become dry.
28. (Turkey) After the 4-hour timer goes off, check the turkey's internal temperature. It's done when a thermometer inserted in the thickest part of the thigh reads 160°F, and the juices run clear when you pierce the thigh.
29. (Turkey) Remove the turkey from the oven and place it on a carving board. Tent the turkey loosely with foil and let rest for at least 30 minutes before carving.

30. (Pumpkin Pie) While the turkey is resting, prepare the coconut whipped cream (optional).
31. (Pumpkin Pie) Open the chilled coconut milk can and scoop out the top cream part only. Blend the cream with powdered sugar and vanilla extract.
32. (Pumpkin Pie) Top the chilled pumpkin pies with coconut whipped cream, cocoa powder, and cinnamon, if desired.

Both the Pumpkin Pie and Thanksgiving Turkey should now be ready to serve together.
